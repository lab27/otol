The Indonesian rainforests are amongst the most biodiverse in the world, they provide oxygen for us and regulate our global climate. Nevertheless, 1.3 million hectares of rainforest are destroyed every year in Borneo alone. This is one of the highest deforestation rates worldwide. Day after day, the habitat of orangutans and other critically endangered species is vanishing. Oftentimes, forest is slashed and burnt, resulting in annual forest and peat fires that---in addition to the loss of biodiversity---accelerate climate change and endanger the health of millions of people.

Through the One-Tree-One-Life-Campaign, BOS Schweiz therefore supports the reforestation of destroyed rainforest areas. The tree-planting is done by volunteers as well as local communities and employees of BOS Foundation in Borneo, Indonesia.

Since 2017, the One-Tree-One-Life-Campaign bundles the reforestation and forest conservation efforts of BOS Schweiz. The aim of this campaign is to raise as many funds as possible for the BOS reforestation projects in East-Kalimantan (Samboja Lestari) and Central-Kalimantan (in the Mawas area).
