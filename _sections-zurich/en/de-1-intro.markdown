When you have your vehicle repaired through Zurich Help Point, you protect the environment twice over: Zurich Insurance Company Ltd organizes repairs through its network using the most modern resource-saving methods and plants on your behalf – as part of the One-Tree-One-Life-Campaign of Borneo Orangutan Survival Association (BOS) Schweiz – a tree seedling in Borneo, Indonesia.
