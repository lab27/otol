Likewise, it is important to preserve one of the most valuable but heavily affected and degraded peat swamp forests of Indonesia located in the Mawas area. 

During the 1990s, Indonesia aimed to fight widespread hunger by establishing a self-sufficient rice production. For that purpose, about 1 million hectares of peat forest were designated for rice cultivation and destroyed. In Borneo alone, 4,000km of drainage canals were created to allow for this agricultural production. The plan did not succeed, and the rice project has been abandoned.

Since 2003, BOS Foundation in Indonesia has been responsible for protecting and restoring some of those destroyed areas in the Mawas region. This is critical because the Mawas conservation forest is home to more than 2,500 wild orangutans---one of the largest known wild orangutan populations in the world! 

In 2013, Mawas was declared an area of high conservation value. However, illegal logging, poaching as well as wildfires continue to threaten the precious wildlife and its habitat. The former drainage canals facilitate these illegal activities: they are frequently used to enter the conservation area and to transport illegally cut wood and bush meat. In addition, in 2015 and 2019, large forest areas were destroyed by fires. Because peat forests store up to 50 times more carbon than usual rainforests, fires in those areas as well as the drying-out of the peat swamps have a devastating effect on our world climate. 

Through the One-Tree-One-Life-Campaign, BOS Schweiz supports two reforestation projects in the Mawas area: the Tuanan Project and the SOS Borneo Project. Both initiatives aim to close drainage channels, to train and equip fire protection teams and to replant burnt and otherwise degraded areas. Seedlings are grown in our own tree nurseries and planted by local communities. Accompanying microcredit projects establish alternative sources of income to stop illegal logging and poaching.

### Thank you for supporting the One-Tree-One-Life-Campaign and thus these reforestation initiatives!
