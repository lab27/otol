Borneo Orangutan Survival Association (BOS) Schweiz is a registered non-profit organization headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland. Together with its international partner organizations---above all BOS Foundation in Indonesia---BOS Schweiz aims to permanently protect the last orangutans and preserve their habitat, the tropical rainforest in Borneo. For this purpose, BOS maintains what is currently the largest primate rescue and rehabilitation program in the world: in two rescue and rehabilitation centers in Borneo, injured, traumatized and orphaned orangutans receive urgent medical treatment and are---up to 10 years---prepared for a life in freedom. Since 1991, BOS has rescued over 3000 orangutans. Since 2012, almost 500 have been released back into the wild in protected forest areas and about 400 are currently waiting to be released. Closely linked to these activities are reforestation projects, initiatives to promote sustainable development in Indonesia (microcredit projects, health initiatives and environmental education) as well as educational and public relations work in Switzerland.
