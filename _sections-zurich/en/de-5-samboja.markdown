In 2015, 300 hectares of rainforest around the BOS rescue and rehabilitation center in Samboja Lestari also fell victim to the flames. Today and as part of the One-Tree-One-Life-Campaign, BOS Schweiz is replanting this area together with volunteers and employees of BOS Foundation. The seedlings are produced locally and grown in our own tree nurseries. A mix of fruit and timber trees are planted---all endemic and mostly endangered species. Around 220 hectares still need to be replanted in Samboja Lestari.

The Samboja Lestari forest is not home to a wild orangutan population. Instead, BOS uses the forest to prepare recued but traumatized, injured or orphaned orangutans for a life in the wild. Today, Samboja Lestari is one of the last green islands in the region which needs to be conserved.
